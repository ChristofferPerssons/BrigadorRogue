Requirements:
64bit Windows GoG version of Brigador v1.63 (haven't tested other versions of the executable but I highly doubt they'll work)

Installation:
Extract the downloaded zip folder to the folder where brigador.exe is located. 

Enabling the mod:
1. Run brigador.exe
2. Run BrigadorInjector.exe
3. When selecting a district during freelancer new buttons should now appear under the district

Uninstallation:
Remove the files from the folder. 

Information:
* Do not press an upgrade button quickly in succession. This WILL cause your freelancer run to end due to the game returning to the main menu.
* You can run Brigador without the mod by simply not executing BrigadorInjector.exe after starting brigador.exe.
* Each upgrade costs 500'000$.
* Each upgrade decreases or increases performance by 10% (or a flat +1 for projectile count).

Bugs:
Exiting the application may result in a crash, and/or crash message. I do not know precisely why this is the case but it should not cause any issues.
There will be more bugs.
