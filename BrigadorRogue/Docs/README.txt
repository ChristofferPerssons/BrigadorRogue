Requirements:
64bit Windows GoG version of Brigador v1.63 (haven't tested other versions but I highly doubt they'll work)

Installation:
Extract the downloaded zip folder to the folder where brigador.exe is located. Should be 5 new files.
Launch the mod with BrigadorRogue.exe

Uninstallation:
Remove the files from the folder. 

Information:
* Anti-virus seems to hate the mod executable. I do not have the know how to fix this.
* Do not press an upgrade button quickly in succession. This WILL cause your freelancer run to end due to the game returning to the main menu.
* You can run Brigador without the mod by simply not executing BrigadorRogue.exe.
* Each upgrade costs 500'000$.
* Each upgrade decreases or increases performance by 10% (or a flat +1 for projectile count).

Bugs:
Exiting the application may result in a crash, and/or crash message. I do not know precisely why this is the case but it should not cause any issues.
There will be more bugs.
