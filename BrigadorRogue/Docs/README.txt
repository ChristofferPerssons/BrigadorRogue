Brigador Rogue V0.5
This mod injects randomized progression into your freelancer runs. 
Increase your destructive and defensive capability by purchasing upgrades for your mech and weapons. Don't like your current death machine? Buy a new one! Swap your tiny Fork's peashooter for a Gutterball and enjoy the carnage. The sky is the limit!

Each upgrade you purchase randomizes the selection and increases all prices. The increased cost is reset after completing a mission.

Requirements:
BrigadorRogue: 64bit Windows GoG version of Brigador v1.63.
BrigadorPatcher: Both GoG and Steam version of Brigador v1.63 have been reported to work.

Installation:
1. Extract the downloaded zip folder to the folder where brigador.exe is located. There should be 6 new files.
2. Launch the mod with BrigadorRogue.exe.

(Optional) Increasing packfile size:
Run BrigadorPatcher and follow the instruction to increase the vanilla packfile size limit by up to 2x.
If for some reason the brigador executable you are patching is incompatible, no modification to the executable is made and you'll see an error.

Uninstallation:
If used previously, rerun the BrigadorPatcher and choose the "unpatch" option.
Remove the mod files from the folder. 

Information:
* Anti-viruses seems to hate the mod executable and dll. I do not have the know how to fix this.
* This mod should (hopefully) be compatible with all resource mods. Modded mechs and weapons should show up for purchase as long as the packfile has been generated with them in it.
* You can run Brigador without the mod by simply not executing BrigadorRogue.exe.
* Do not press an purchase button quickly in succession. This WILL cause your freelancer run to end due to the game returning to the main menu.


Known bugs:
* Names of weapons and mechs often overflow the confines of its button.
* Exiting the application may result in a crash, and/or crash message. I do not know precisely why this is the case but it should not cause any issues.
* Deploying with the same weapon in both the primary and secondary slots leads to no effect by primary upgrades and secondary upgrades affecting both weapons.
* Laser and flame weapons (more specifically weapons that do not use bullet resources) see no change when the structural damage upgrade is purchased.
* Purchasing primary/seconday weapons for a mech without the corresponding sockets leads your money being stolen.
* I've seen crashes from some vehicles(?) when resigning a freelancer run. 
* Purchasing some mechs may crash your game. Mother's Love for example, although I haven't tested or seen it happen recently.
* There will be more bugs.
